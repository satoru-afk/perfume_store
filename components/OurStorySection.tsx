            Once upon a time, in a galaxy not so far away, a perfumer gazed at the
            stars and wondered, what if each constellation had its own scent?
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            Thus began our journey to capture the essence of celestial wonder in
            every bottle. Like the Little Prince who traveled from planet to
            planet, we explore the universe of fragrance, seeking the most
            extraordinary notes to compose our olfactory tales.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
            Each perfume is crafted with the same care as the Prince tended his
            rose - with patience, love, and the belief that what is essential
            is
            invisible to the eye, but can be felt through the heart... and the
            nose.
